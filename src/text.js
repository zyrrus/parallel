Anyone with ideas worth sharing is encouraged to sign up as an \"Educator\" and post \"jobs\" on the discover page. Content creators can sign up as \"Animators\" to accept these jobs from educators. Alternatively, animators can make their own discover page posts to present their skills so educators are able to request an animator's work."
