A platform where educators and content creators can meet up and create videos together.

Built with [`create-t3-app`](https://create.t3.gg/).

## Why?

Parallel was born from the realization that aspiring educational content creators often lack inspiration and subject expertise, while educators, despite possessing valuable knowledge, struggle with the time and resources needed for online content creation. The platform aims to bridge this gap by providing a collaborative space where educators and content creators could group together to collaborate on projects. Educators can contribute their domain knowledge and expertise, while content creators bring these concepts to life through animations and visualizations, fostering the creation of high-quality educational content.
